# JSON

A minimal single file include implementation of a JSON parser written in both
C++ and Java.

The intention isn't to be the fastest or most memory efficient (although that
would be good), but to be understandable.

## TODO

* [ ] Automatically run tests upon a single build command
* [ ] Profile the performance of the parsers
* [ ] Compare against existing parsers
